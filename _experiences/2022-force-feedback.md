The project aims to develop an image registration algorithm to align ultrasound images with stereo images and display them in VR glasses, utilizing a 6-axis force sensor and force feedback handle to achieve remote ultrasound diagnosis with force feedback in virtual reality.

* Development of ultrasound image and stereo image registration algorithm based on **C++**, **OpenCV** and **Eigen** to realize efficient real-time registration algorithm;
* Socket-based image transmission and signal transmission to realize low-latency, high-quality image and signal transmission;
* Force feedback modeling, data denoising, force feedback handle control to realize more realistic force feedback teleoperation control;
