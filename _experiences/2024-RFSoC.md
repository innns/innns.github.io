This project aims to implement an ultra-high speed signal generation and acquisition system using Xilinx RFSoC. The system utilizes digital IQ mixers to generate and acquire RF signals at carrier frequencies of 4-8 Ghz by interpolating and filtering the signals and converting them to quadrature modulation D/A or A/D.

I was responsible for:

* Development of RFSoC driver to control A/D, D/A, IQ mixer, filter, attenuator, etc.;
* Communicate with existing software stack via TCP;
* Development of assembly-like code to support implementation of nanosecond-level delay control;
