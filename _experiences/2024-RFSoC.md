This project aims to implement an ultra-high speed signal generation and acquisition system using Xilinx RFSoC. The system utilizes digital IQ mixers to generate and acquire RF signals at carrier frequencies of 4-8 Ghz by interpolating and filtering the signals and converting them to quadrature modulation D/A or A/D.

* FPGA Driver Development;
* Communicate with existing experimental frames via TCP;
* Wrote assembly-like code to support implementation of ultra-high-speed timing control;
