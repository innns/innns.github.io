The aim of the project is to design a robotic palletizer with AGV to perform the tasks in a simplified factory environment. The robot finally participated in China University Engineering Practice and Innovation Ability Competition and won the second prize.

I was responsible for:

* Development of navigation system based on gyros, odometers and guide lines of the environment;
* Development of high precision vision algorithm based on **C++** and **OpenCV**;
* Development of robot chassis control program

Specific docs and code (of vision code) is available at [github](https://github.com/innns/GCXL-Conveying-Robot-CV/tree/master)
