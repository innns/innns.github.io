This project aims to achieve a visual servoing motion compensation for surgical robots by controlling the robot's end-effector's current. A virtualized robot model is implemented in Unity to facilitate controller training, which is subsequently deployed in the real-world robot.

I was responsible for:

* System identification for the robot;
* Training the motion compensation controller in a virtual environment;
* Deploying the controller in the real-world robot;
