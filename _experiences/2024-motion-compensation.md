This project aims to train an end-to-end motion compensation model that can be applied to surgical robotic systems by building digital twins in **Unity** for deep reinforcement learning. The model accomplishes smooth motion compensation by directly generating control quantities of end moments through visual inputs.

* Digital twin of surgical machinery built in **Unity ML Agent** based on **system identification**;
* Training the model in a virtual environment by **SAC-LSTM** / **PPO-LSTM**;
* Sim2Real deployment;
