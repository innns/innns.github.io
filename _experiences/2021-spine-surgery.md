The project aims to design a surgical navigation and teleoperation system for robot-assisted spine surgery, realizing a high-precision positioning system; path planning and navigation of puncture; automated execution of puncture; teleoperation robot arm control.

I was responsible for:

* Development of high-precision algorithm based on **Python** and **NumPy** to achieve sub-millimeter accuracy;
* Development of the forward and inverse solution and motion control of the 6-axis robot arm;
* Development of teleoperation control system based on real-time feedback to achieve low-latency teleoperation control;
* Development of the visualization of the system based on **QT** and **VTK**
