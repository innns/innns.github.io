The project aims to design a surgical navigation and teleoperation system for robot-assisted spine surgery, realizing a high-precision positioning system; spin puncture path planning and navigation; teleoperation robot arm control.

* Development of high-precision visual algorithm based on **C++**, **OpenCV** and **Eigen** to achieve sub-millimeter accuracy;
* Use D-H method to model the 6-axis robot arm, and realize the forward and inverse solution and motion control of the 6-axis robot arm;
* Develop a teleoperation control system based on real-time feedback to achieve low-latency teleoperation control;
