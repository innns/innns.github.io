The study introduces a novel dual-domain reconstruction network for Sparse-View Computed Tomography (SVCT) that employs two parallel inference branches: a sinogram-domain branch and an image-domain branch, fused by a global attention module to produce the final CT image.

* The parallel structure of the dual-domain network ensures that errors from the 
sinogram-domain do not affect the image-domain model's inference, allowing for 
full utilization of the complementary advantages of dual-domain processing.
* A lightweight CNN interpolation module is concatenated with several Transformer encoders in the sinogram-domain branch to recover the full-view sinogram from sparse-view input, marking the first CNN and Transformer composite model specifically designed for SVCT to interpolate and repair missing projection views.
* The proposed network demonstrates excellent performance in SVCT reconstruction across various sparsity levels, effectively suppressing noise while preserving details from the original image. The network is validated on a benchmark dataset from the Mayo Clinic, ensuring the reliability and generalizability of the results.
